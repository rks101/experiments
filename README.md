## Algorithms to Live By from Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths    

What should we do, or leave undone,    
in a day or lifetime?    

How do we solve common decision-making problems?     
How do you have better hunches, when to leave things to chance?      
How to deal with overwhelming choices, or how best to connect with others?    

Our Computers' methods or algorithms have much to teach us.     

From finding your spouse to finding a parking spot, and from organizing your inbox to understanding the workings of memory - where you have a dilemma, they - computers have a rule.    

When to stop looking, they - computers have a rule.

We can **be Computationally kind** and **be storage-wise grateful**.
